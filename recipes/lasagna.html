    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce or marinara sauce, Italian seasoning (if using), salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and egg until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top.</li>

        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
